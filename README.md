# PRODIGY_GAI_04
This project demonstrates the implementation of an image-to-image translation model using a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) known as pix2pix. The model translates images from one domain to another, achieving impressive results in tasks like turning sketches into realistic images, enhancing photos, and more.
